Intro
-----
Veritas is Symantec's tape backup utility.

Prior to extracting files from a DLT, you must first extract the DLT's catalog.
This catalog is the directory into the DLT's contents, which is the actual file 
structure. In this way the catalog can be thought of as the file system of a DLT.  
If the catalog is damaged, the files it points to will be irretrievable, just as
a damaged FAT wil ruin your day especially if it occurs on your XXX folder.

During the cataloging process, Veritas generates catalog files and stores them on
the user's hard disk, usually in "C:\Program Files\VERITAS\Backup Exec\NT\Catalogs".

The catalog file name looks like a GUID and comes in pairs, one with the extension 
.IMG and the other .FH.

There was a need to programatically grab the file structure of a DLT tape and my 
first idea was to communicate directly via SCSI with the backup unit. I realized that 
figuring this out would take quite some time, and after a bit of Googling I was turned 
to the command-line CATDUMP utility provided by Veritas themselves.

It worked (most of the time), but I wanted more control over the catalog dumping 
process, and CATDUMP occasionally would crash (on some PCs?) for some unknown reason.

Using CATDUMP's output as a sample for comparison I was able to figure out what most 
values meant.

Please note that this file format spec is for catalog version 4.5 or Veritas 9.x (?)
